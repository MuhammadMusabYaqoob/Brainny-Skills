fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)


11. You are creating an invoice system. Ask for the quantity and price of a product, calculate total, apply 10% discount, and print final amount.
Solution:
qty = int(input("Enter quantity: "))
price = float(input("Enter price per item: "))
total = qty * price
discount = total * 0.10
final_amount = total - discount
print("Final amount after 10% discount:", final_amount)



discount_percent = 10
discount = total * discount_percent / 100
final_amount = total - discount




Let the user enter the discount
discount_percent = float(input("Enter discount percentage: "))
discount = total * (discount_percent / 100)
final_amount = total - discount
